# CS402 Introduction to Logic for Computer Science, Spring 2021, KAIST 

This is a webpage of the course "CS402 Introduction to Logic for Computer Science", which is offered at the KAIST CS department in the spring of 2021. The webpage will contain links to course-related materials and announcements.

CS402 is a course on logic with emphasis on its use for computer science. Its goal is to expose students to the computational aspects of logic, in particular, key mathematical results and algorithms behind modern SAT solvers and theorem provers. The course involves a large amount of mathematics and theoretical computer science, in particular, computational complexity, verification, and programming languages. We assume that students are fluent in reading and proving mathematical theorems, and that they understand basic concepts from computability and complexity course, such as decidability, NP-completeness and reduction.

## 1. Important Announcements

#### [February 22] Policy for handling late submissions.

We will adopt the following scheme for handling late submissions for homework assignments and critical surveys. The scheme assumes that the total marks are 100.

1. <= One day late (by the midnight of the next day): -10
2. <= Two days late: -20
3. <= Three days late: -30
4. <= Four days late: -40
5. More than four days late: -100.

#### [February 22] Honour code.

We adopt a very strict policy for handling dishonest behaviours. If a student is found to copy answers from peers or other sources in her or his submission for any assignment, he or she will get F.

## 2. Logistics

#### Evaluation

* Homework (40%). In-class oral tests (30%). Programming assignment and report (20%). One critical survey (10%).

#### Teaching Staffs

#### Place and Time

* Place: ZOOM.

* In-class oral tests: Four sessions on chosen Mondays, with two scheduled during the mid-term and final exam periods. Look at "4. In-class Oral Tests".
* Recorded lectures: Online lectures available from Youtube. The schedule to watch these lectures and the links to them can be found in "5. Tentative Plan".

#### Online Discussion

* We will use KLMS.

## 3. Homework

Submit your solutions in KLMS. We will create submission folders for all the homework assignments in KLMS.

## 4. In-class Oral Tests

We will run four in-class oral tests using ZOOM. During these tests, students will be randomly chosen and asked questions about topics covered by the course. We allocate 7.5% of the total marks of the course to each test. If a student does not attend one of the tests, she or he will get 0 for that test. The four tests will be scheduled on the following dates:

* 03/29(Mon) - In-class oral test at ZOOM from 9:00am - 10:30am.
* 04/19(Mon) (Midterm Exam Week) - In-class oral test at ZOOM from 9:00am - 10:30am.
* 05/17(Mon) - In-class oral test at ZOOM from 9:00am - 10:30am.
* 06/14(Mon) (Final Exam Week) - In-class oral test at ZOOM from 9:00am - 10:30am.

We adopt the following policy for these tests.

1. We do attendance check at 9:30am, but if a student is called before this attendence check but is absent, she or he will get 0.
2. In these tests, students will have to answer questions using their microphones. Also, they will have to 
turn on their cameras, at least when we do attendance check. Thus, students are strongly advised to ensure that 
their microphones and cameras work properly before these oral tests. If a student cannot use a microphone and a camera 
because of a special circumstance, she or he has to explain the circumstance to the teaching staffs before the test
and arrange a way to participate in the test.
3. During these tests, students do not have to answer in English, although questions will be asked in English.

## 7. Critical Survey

One important part of this course is to study an assigned topic for oneself, and write a survey about it, which also contains critiques or original thoughts of the student. This assignment accounts for the 10% of the total marks of this course. In order to get full marks, a student has to show in his or her write-up that she or he has understood the topic well, carried out in-depth studies on the topic, and thought hard and originally about it. Our evaluation adopts the following criterion: the clarity of writing (20%), the level of understanding a topic and existing work about it (40%), and the demonstration of original thoughts and insights (40%). Here are the details of this assignment.

1. Don't postpone this assignments until the last moment.
2. A submission should be at most 3 pages not including bibliography.
3. Topic: MaxSAT Solver.
4. Deadline: __**23:59 of the 3rd of May in 2021 (Monday). Summit in KLMS.**__
5. Thinking about the following questions may help you.
   1. What is a MaxSAT solver? 
   2. What are the most popular algorithms used for efficient modern MaxSAT solvers? Are the ideas from the DPLL algorithm and clause learning used in those solves? If so, why? If not, why not?
   3. What are the common applications of MaxSAT solvers? What would be a new interesting application for those solvers? For that application, do you expect that the algorithms for MaxSAT solvers or the interfaces to the solvers should be changed? If yes, how?
   4. How well do modern MaxSAT solvers perform? What are the most popular MaxSAT solvers?
   5. What do you think should be the next step in the work on MaxSAT solvers?

## 8. Programming Assignment and Report

#### 8.1. Topic

Implement a SAT solver using the DPLL algorithm with clause learning, which we cover in the course.

#### 8.2. Deadline

__**23:59 of the 24th of May in 2021 (Monday).**__ Summit both your implementation and report in KLMS.

#### 8.3. Programming Language to Use

Python 2.7 and 3.x.

#### 8.4. Format of Input and Output

1. Follow DIMACS input/output requirements. You can learn about these requirements at the following URL: [http://www.satcompetition.org/2009/format-benchmarks2009.html](http://www.satcompetition.org/2009/format-benchmarks2009.html). This is the format used in the SAT competition. 
2. Assume that the input is always in CNF format.

#### 8.5. Input Interface

The main file of your solver should be named as follows:

solvepy2.py --- if you are using python 2.7
solvepy3.py --- if you are usin python 3.x

We plan to write a script that runs your solver with a cnf formula stored in a file (according to DIMACS format). The script searches for the solvepy2.py or solvepy3.py file in your submission, and runs something like

python2 solvepy2.py "testn.cnf" --- when solvepy2.py is found,
python3 solvepy3.py "testn.cnf" --- when solvepy3.py is found.

Here "testn.cnf" is just an example name of a file containing a cnf formula in DIMACS format. Of course, different test cases will use different names.

#### 8.6. Output Interface

The output should specify SATISFIABLE/UNSATISFIABLE using s and give a partial assignment using v. So, if your solver is run

python3 solvepy3.py "test1.cnf"

but "test1.cnf" is unsatisfiable and your solver finds this out, it should return

s UNSATISFIABLE

in the standard output. On the other hand, if your solver is run

python3 solvepy3.py "test2.cnf"

but "test2.cnf" is satisfiable and your solver finds a satisfying partial assignment (2, 5, -7) meaning that variables 2 and 5 have the value 1 and the variable 7 has the value -1 in the found partial assignment, then your solver should return

s SATISFIABLE
v 2 5 -7 0

Here 0 indicates the end of the found partial assignment. The description of a found partial assignment can be across multiple lines. For instance, in the above case, the solver may return

s SATISFIABLE
v 2 5
v -7 0

#### 8.7. What to Submit in KLMS?

1. Source code of your implementation. Make sure that you follow the specifications described above. We plan to write a script that compiles and runs your code on some test cases automatically.
2. 1-2 page summary on what you did.

#### 8.8. Test Cases

The following webpages contain benchmark problems in DIMACS format: [https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~hoos/SATLIB/benchm.html](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~hoos/SATLIB/benchm.html) and [http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/cnf/cnf.html](http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/cnf/cnf.htm).

#### 8.9. Final Remark

The correctness matters the most. Make sure that your implementation handles corner cases correctly.

## 9. Study Materials

Reading the lecture notes is the recommended way to study the topics that we cover. Another useful book is Bradley and Manna's book "The Calculus of Computation", which also presents logic from the perspective of computation.
